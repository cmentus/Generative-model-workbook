# Tensor Flow Generative Models

A simple library for learning and experimenting with generative models: GAN, VAE and others.

# GAN workbook
Challenges:
* Challenge 1: Gan to generate mixture of gaussian
* Challenge 2: Cycle GAN to transform between two dimensional probability measures.
* Challenge 3: GAN for importance sampling weights for control and treatment groups.
