# Tensor Flow Generative Models

* A simple repo for learning and experimenting with generative models: GAN, VAE and others.
* The aim is to provide a simple framework for building a variety of models and prototyping them in simple settings.
* Emphasis is on the probabilistic aspects of generative models such as how close is the generator to the true data generating process.
* This might be useful as coursework teaching GAN to undergrads/grads.

# GAN workbook
Challenges:
* Challenge 1: Gan to generate mixture of gaussian
* Challenge 2: Cycle GAN to transform between two dimensional probability measures.
* Challenge 3: GAN for importance sampling weights for control and treatment groups.
